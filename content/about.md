I’m a hands-on engineering leader with a long-standing focus on real-time and physically based graphics, ray tracing, and modern rendering frameworks. Much of my experience comes from building and contributing to systems that artists and developers rely on every day.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with ISVs, end users, and open-source communities to help move ideas from early research into practical, production-ready tools. I enjoy the combination of deep technical work, collaborative problem-solving, and the kind of steady, thoughtful iteration that turns a prototype into something people can depend on.I’ve had the opportunity to lead cross-functional engineering teams developing platform-level graphics technologies and have spent a lot of time aligning technical direction with longer-term product and ecosystem needs. 

More recently, I've been exploring modern GPU programming models, shader portability, neural rendering, and how AI-assisted workflows can open up new possibilities for graphics and engineering teams. This site is where I share what I'm learning, experimenting with, and thinking through along the way.

Thanks for stopping by.
