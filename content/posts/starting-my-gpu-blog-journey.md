Welcome to the first entry in what I expect will become a running log of technical exploration.

I wanted a space to capture the things I’m learning and experimenting with — from GPU programming, rendering techniques, and shader languages to the growing role of AI in graphics, visual storytelling, and the tools we use to build and iterate. My interests move between low-level systems work and the workflows that shape how engineers and creators actually get things done, so the posts here will reflect that mix.

Some entries will be short notes or experiments. Others may dig deeper into concepts, patterns, or tools I’m trying out. I’m not aiming for a single theme — more an evolving technical journal that documents ideas while they’re still fresh.

If you’ve found your way here, I hope you come across something useful or interesting as this space develops.
